Now that it has reached a solid state I need to focus on my indie game development and I can no longer work on it as intensively. Therefore, I have decided to make it open-source and grant public access.\\n\\n## What\'s next for Jenova?\\nI will keep pushing updates if any changes are made to the proprietary version. Meanwhile, contributions, including improvements, fixes, or new implementations, are always welcome.\\n\\n## Public Access\\nJenova Source Code is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework/Jenova-Runtime) for everyone under MIT license.\\n\\nIf you have any question or issue building Jenova Runtime you can create a thread at [Jenova Forums](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework/J.E.N.O.V.A/discussions)."}]}}')}}]);
